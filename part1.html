		 <P>Belly dance, which is said to be the oldest dance in the world, was the beginning
			  of the shrine maidens dancing as a ceremony for the worship of the goddess.
				And as a dance to celebrate fertility, Arab women continued to inherit it.
				The current sophisticated show style have been built by gypsies who continued their
				journey from India to the west.
				Belly dance is popular in Egypt, Turkey, but you can also see it in Morocco,
				Greece, Dubai, Lebanon, etc.</p>
